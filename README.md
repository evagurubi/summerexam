## Overview

The ELTforYOU application was designed with the needs of the teachers at a language school or the English faculty of any secondary school in mind. could make good use of a database of activities that is based on news articles, relevant issues, current events etc. all very "authentic". And teachers need ideas for warmers, links to articles, more background info as well as "useable" photos/ images that students can compare and contrast. Teachers could search by keyword or title, but content is also made searchable - partly because it was one of the requirements :)) but also because we just want to show students how one particular expression might come up in an authentic text.

## Technologies

The project was created using:

- React
- Node

## Launch

In the project frontend directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the project backend directory, you can run:

`nodemon start.js`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!\*\*

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
